    "## Overview\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to take state election data as reported by the Associated Press (via api) and analyze this data for consistency.  The data for the 2020 Presidential election has already been pulled and can be found on Github (as of 07/26/2022).  There are two reasons that I am looking at this data:  \n",
    "1.  Polling data reported by the AP often does not make sense initially since the data is coming from every polling station and states are trying to disperse the results of each data batch as the information arrives.  It is not uncommon for states to include adjustments to correct data that was mis-reported or was re-counted.  Also, each state has their own way of reporting the information.  \n",
    "2.  In time I would like to take this data and make a visualization that better illustrates how vote tallies are changing over time."
